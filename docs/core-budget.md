## Overview

This document defines a **Dual Universe–accurate core budget and expansion simulation** for a large floating base built over water, consisting of:

* Central vertical tower with landing pads
* Dedicated HQ complex
* Ship Sales district
* Storefront commercial district
* Tiered factory zones (L / M / S cores)
* Minimized S-core bridge usage
* L-core–first structural philosophy

All values are derived from known **Dual Universe core mechanics** and an **organization core limit of 282**.

## Assumptions Used

### Organizational Constraints

* **Org Core Limit:** 282
* **Currently Deployed:** 127
* **Remaining Available:** 155 cores

---

### Design Constraints

* Primary platform sections use **L cores**
* Factories are mixed **L / M / S**
* Bridges must **minimize S cores**
* Storefront is a **dedicated district**, not a relabeled HQ
* HQ is a **standalone structure**
* Ship Sales is a **separate large platform**
* Vertical stacking avoided (top-down planar expansion)

## Current Planned Core Usage

### Primary Structures (L Cores)

| Section                               | L Cores |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Central Tower + Landing Pads          | 5       |
| Main Base Ring / Spine                | 6       |
| HQ Complex                            | 2       |
| Ship Sales District                   | 4       |
| Storefront District                   | 4       |
| Heavy Factory Zone (L-core factories) | 6       |
| **Subtotal (L)**                      | **27**  |

---

### Factory Zones (Mixed Cores)

#### Medium Factories (Refining / Assembly)

| Description                                    | M Cores |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Medium Factory Clusters (3 clusters × 4 cores) | 12      |
| **Subtotal (M)**                               | **12**  |

#### Light Factories / Utility

| Description                  | S Cores |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Light Factory Units          | 18      |
| **Subtotal (S – factories)** | **18**  |

---

### Bridges & Connectors

S-core usage is intentionally minimized by favoring long-span L-core platforms.

| Connector Type                       | Core Type | Count |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ----- |
| Main arterial bridges                | L         | 4     |
| Secondary connectors                 | M         | 6     |
| Fine-grain access (short spans only) | S         | 10    |

---

## Total Core Budget – Initial Build

### Combined Totals

| Core Size           | Count  |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| **L**               | **37** |
| **M**               | **18** |
| **S**               | **28** |
| **Total New Cores** | **83** |

---

## Organization Core Budget Status

| Metric                 | Count   |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| Org Limit              | 282     |
| Already Deployed       | 127     |
| New Planned Build      | 83      |
| **Post-Build Total**   | **210** |
| **Remaining Capacity** | **72**  |

---

## Maximum Expansion Simulation

With **72 cores remaining**, the following expansion path is recommended for maximum utility without exceeding limits.

### Optimal Expansion Allocation

| Expansion Type               | Core Type | Count  |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Additional Heavy Factories   | L         | 12     |
| Expanded Ship Sales Pads     | L         | 6      |
| Storefront Expansion Wings   | M         | 12     |
| Specialized Light Industry   | S         | 18     |
| Additional Bridges / Utility | M         | 6      |
| **Expansion Total**          | —         | **54** |

---

## Remaining Safety Margin

* **Unused cores after max expansion:** **18**

These are intentionally reserved for:

* Emergency rebuilds
* Temporary constructs
* Event structures
* Testing and prototyping cores

---

### Notes

* This layout remains **well below the organizational core cap**
* S-core usage is controlled to avoid connector bloat
* Plan supports **horizontal expansion** without rework
* Safe margin allows for **future patches or balance changes**
